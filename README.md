# README

# Due to the significant computing resources required for this project, the training and testing of the model are 
conducted on the Google Colab platform. To run this project, please copy the folder 'AMLSII_23-24_SN23202365' 
to the '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks' path and then click 'Run All'.

## a brief description of the organization of the project
The project consists of a main.ipynb file and a Datasets folder. For better compatibility with Google Colab, the code is 
written in .ipynb file rather than .py file. The Datasets consist of train and test folders and a train.csv file, representing 
the training set, test set, and training set labels, respectively.
